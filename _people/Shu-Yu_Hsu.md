Hi there, Kevin speaking!
I received my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan Normal University.  I used to intern at Oath from 2017 July to December.

My research interests are  computer vision and deep learning, especially application of Generative Aversarial Network(GAN) on fashion styles.
