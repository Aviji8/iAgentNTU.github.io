<br />

I am currently pursuing PhD degree in National Taiwan University while working as a software engineer as well as a project manager. I received my mater's degree in industrial engineering from National Chiao Tung University in 2004 and bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from National Tsing Hua University in 2002.

I am quite interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation. Those two research fields are important for human-computer and human-human communication. My research goal would be removing these communication barriers.
