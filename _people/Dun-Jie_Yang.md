Hi people! This is Yang Dun Jie and you can call me Jeffy.
I am currently pursuing Master degree in National Taiwan University.
I received my bachelor's degree in machanical engineering from NCKU in 2019.
My favorite lab is iAgentsLab. 

My research interests are Machine Learning, Recommender System and Human Computer Interaction. Although I still do not have concrete idea, my goal is to make people feel that machines are intelligent, machines have thought, and machines can understand people’s need.
