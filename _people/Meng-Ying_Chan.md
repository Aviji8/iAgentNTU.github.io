<br />

I completed my masterâ€™s degree in computer science at National Taiwan University(NTU) in 2016 and finished mandatory military service in November 2017. I am now seeking the opportunity to become a product manager.

I am a person who likes to use an optimistic attitude to face the problems, stand in one's shoes to think it in different perspectives, and then discuss the proper solutions according to the resources. Also, I am interested in the fields of technology and business strategy, I have participated in many cross-field projects. In these projects, I often acted as the team leader. Not only programming, but I was also responsible for planning the project progress, break down the work into task rationally, communicate and reorganize the different views between the team members so that the team has a shared core value. To sum up, I love to design and develop better products so that everyone can enjoy the convenience and comfort of life.
