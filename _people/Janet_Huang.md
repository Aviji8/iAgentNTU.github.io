Yi-Ching (Janet) Huang got her master degree in computer science from National Taiwan University in 2008. Now, she is a Ph.D student in Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University. Her research topic is focused on Social Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction and Information visualization. She is passionate about discovering the story behind the large amounts of data. She tried to find the relationship among people, object, time, and event through different aspects. She want to leverage those findings to design better applications for fitting the human's need in real life. She attended several workshops on interaction design and these events inspired my interest in this field. Her enthusiasm is in combining technology and design process to produce some creative work to satisfy human need or bring good experience to human.
