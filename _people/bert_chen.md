Hi, this is PC Chen. I am currently a Master student from NTU. My research interest includes NLP, CV, unsupervised learning and transfer learning. I'm exploring my talent in AI domain and now studying multi-modality opinion recognition. I have worked on projects related to medical AI, chatbot and competitions like JDDC, NTU Hackthon. I find myself happy and frustrated when doing research. Struggling with research, however, I still enjoy learning and trying to keep up this AI trend.
