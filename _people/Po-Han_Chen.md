Hi, I'm Brian. I started pursuing my master degree in fall, 2014. I have two years working experience as BIOS engineer during 2011 to 2013. After that, I worked several short-term intern in different tech-company.

I'm focusing on Internet of Things. I'm using wearable devices for analyzing quality and performance of the athlete and also designing a monitoring system for facilitating self-training. I hope these kinds of technology can reduce the loading of coaches and increase the efficiency of training.
