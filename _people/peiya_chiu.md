Hi, my name is Pei-Ya Chiu. I'm a master student in Computer Science. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering from NTU in 2012. In the same year I started working as a full-stack developer in Skywatch Inc. Skywatch Innovation delivers surveilence products, computer vision algorithm and IoT cloud platform products.
