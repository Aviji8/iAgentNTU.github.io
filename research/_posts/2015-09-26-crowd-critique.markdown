brief: Feedback is an essential aspect of achieving better result for academic writing. It helps people understand the issue and improve their work in the iterative process. However, obtaining diverse and complete feedbacks from others remains a challenge. Recent studies focus on generating a high-quality single feedback by task decomposition and structured guidance, but neglect the improvement of overall feedback quality. Splitting the feedback process into small pieces in review writing task will loss the big picture in terms of context, struc- ture, and other global information.
