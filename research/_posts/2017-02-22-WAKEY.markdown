brief: Parent-child communication is an essential element in behav- ioral and character development in early childhood; however, parents may find it difficult to be aware of how they talk to their children. Through extensive field studies with ex- perts and parents, we found that parents are more likely to experience communication conflict with preschool children (3-6 years old) on school mornings. In consultation with domain professionals and families, we designed WAKEY, a technology-based approach that helps parents use better com- munication strategies to teach preschool children to carry out their morning routines. Following the intervention with WAKEY, parents reported significantly reduced levels of frus- tration during morning routines and greater independent be- havior by children. Furthermore, parents reported experienc- ing changes in their parenting attitudes and finding new in- sights into communication.
